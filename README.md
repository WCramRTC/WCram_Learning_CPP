# WCram_Learning_CPP
 
1. First goal, get C++ properly installed and running inside my IDE of choice ( probably vs code )

[How to install C++](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-c-and-cpp-compiler-on-windows/)

2. Get my first hello world in c++ going and learn how to deploy.

3. Find out what's going on in my main
   1. What is #include <iostream>
      * iostream is the library for reading input and output streams  
   2. what is using namespace std;
      * `std` stands for standard, as in C++ standard library
      * without std we would have to use `std::cout`

      * ***Is it bad practice?***
      * [G4G : using std, bad practice](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice/#)
   3. int main() - why int?
      * ints are used to return if the program was succesfully ended. Anything other than 0 is an error
      * void main() is an option, but not really used
   4. what is cout and <<
      * used to display characters to the screen. The c stands for character, so character output
   5. why does main return 0, what does it mean.
      * 0 stands for succesfull exit. Anything else means an error happened.

4. Get my fundamentals down
   1. Inputs
   2. Outputs
   3. Loops
   4. Conditions
   5. Variables
   6. Operation
   7. Arrays
   8. Classes
5. Document my journey along the way
6. FInd the difference between my favoriate language ( C Sharp ) and CPP
7. Why do I want to learn CPP. 
   1. CPP is a very popular lower level programming language that gives more power to the programmer for minute detail over garbage collection among other things. It's commonly used in game development and is the primary language ( besides the proprietary Blueprint System. )
8. End goal : What do I want to have built within 4 weeks of starting to learn CPP. A Game for the game dev class.
